## ðŸ§  Sentiment Analysis â€“ NLP & Classification Project

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and classification models to analyze the **sentiment polarity** (positive or negative) of text data. It was developed as part of a university assignment on Artificial Intelligence.

### ðŸ”„ Text Preprocessing

- **Tokenization**  
- **Stopword removal**
- **Lemmatization** and **Stemming**
- **Vectorization** using **Bag of Words**

### ðŸ¤– Modeling & Evaluation

- Built a **Logistic Regression** model to classify sentiment polarity
- Evaluated model performance on a labeled dataset
- Tested additional methods including:
  - **Word2Vec embeddings**
  - **PySentimiento** library for sentiment prediction

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To understand and apply fundamental NLP workflows and evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches for sentiment classification tasks.

Extra:
- A brief experimental use of **Genetic Algorithms**
